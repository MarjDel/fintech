Jim used to be a glassblowing instructor and founded Disconcepts, a CD cabinet manufacturing company.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The initial idea of Square came about when Jim McKelvey struggled to accept payment for his $2000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings in 2009 because he can’t accept credit cards.

He happened to be a friend of Jack Dorsey who co-founded social network company Twitter. 

The idea of small business accepting payment without using credit card is what prompted the founders to create a solution that deals with Jim's problem.

Square Inc is actually very competitive in the POS and credit card processing field. It can be said that it is one of the better options available in the mobile payment world.

## Recommendations:
Square Inc is already a very successful business. 
However, it also has limitations and that the company have acknowledged some of these at their website as well. 

Limitations includes: Poor client support, expensive add-on services, flat-rate pricing can be costly for bigger traders, risky businesses may not be accepted.

In order to improve client support, they should provide a more personal support rather that phone support only to their customers.
Expensive add-ons services should be advised during sign up to avoid frustrations of customers in the future.

For bigger business, maybe a more flexible deal can be organized, or have better deals.
For risky businesses, maybe more background checks during signing up, like uploading IDs, and background check based on the nature of business declared.

Technology wise, I think Square is updated and leads this fintech domain: mobile payment. Maybe a more updated version, as there are few complaints above the Square device being clunky. Maybe a more updated programming language like Kotlin can be used for it's programming software, as per github Kotlin has been used by developers lately.
